            <li>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed
                by
                Guido
                van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis
                on
                code
                readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</li><br>

            <li>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started.
                Soon
                after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum
                Wiskunde
                & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. </li><br>
            <li>It was started firstly as a hobby project
                because
                he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming
                language in
                which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the
                Amoeba
                Operating System and had the feature of exception handling.</li>
            <li> He had already helped to create ABC
                earlier
                in
                his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he
                did
                was
                really very clever.</li><br>
            <li> He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of
                complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that
                had
                removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC's TV Show – 'Monty Python’s Flying
                Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly
                mysterious
                name
                for his invention and hence he named it Python!</li><br>
            <li> He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL)
                until
                he
                stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work
                for
                Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.
                The language was finally released in 1991.</li><br>
            <li> When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express
                the
                concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main
                objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity.
                When it was released it
                had
                more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception
                handling
                and functions.
