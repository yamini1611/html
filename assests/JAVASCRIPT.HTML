            <li>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed
                by
                Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is
                influenced
                by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed
                by
                Sun Microsystems.</li><br>

            <li>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the
                client's
                web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage
                has
                loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web
                form
                before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript
                code
                can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</li><br>

            <li>Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere
                within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML,
                while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced
                in a
                separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.</li>
