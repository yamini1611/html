            <ul style="color: rgb(37, 6, 150); font-size:large;">
                <li>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed
                    by
                    Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is
                    influenced
                    by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed
                    by
                    Sun Microsystems.</li><br>

                <li>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the
                    client's
                    web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage
                    has
                    loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web
                    form
                    before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript
                    code
                    can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</li><br>

                <li>Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere
                    within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML,
                    while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced
                    in a
                    separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.</li>

            <ul style="color: rgb(23, 2, 63); font-size: large;">
                <li>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed
                    by
                    Guido
                    van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis
                    on
                    code
                    readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</li><br>

                <li>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started.
                    Soon
                    after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum
                    Wiskunde
                    & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. </li><br>
                <li>It was started firstly as a hobby project
                    because
                    he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming
                    language in
                    which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the
                    Amoeba
                    Operating System and had the feature of exception handling.</li>
                <li> He had already helped to create ABC
                    earlier
                    in
                    his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he
                    did
                    was
                    really very clever.</li><br>
                <li> He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of
                    complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that
                    had
                    removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC's TV Show – 'Monty Python’s Flying
                    Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly
                    mysterious
                    name
                    for his invention and hence he named it Python!</li><br>
                <li> He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL)
                    until
                    he
                    stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work
                    for
                    Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.
                    The language was finally released in 1991.</li><br>
                <li> When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express
                    the
                    concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main
                    objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity.
                    When it was released it
                    had
                    more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception
                    handling
                    and functions.

            <ul style="color: rgb(46, 23, 6); font-size: large;">
                <li>CSS is another thing you may learn just after understanding HTML. CSS stands for the cascading style
                    sheets,
                    which Hakon Wium Lie created in 1994. Hakon Wium Lie is considered the father of CSS as he created
                    this
                    amazing thing. And he used to work with the father of HTML, Mr. Tim Berners-Lee, when he was working
                    in
                    CERN.</li><br>

                <li>CSS was offered as the web styling language to make it appealing. And it was the solution that most
                    of
                    the
                    users of HTML were looking at that time. When it launched, the users could use HTML 4.01 and CSS
                    together to
                    make their web pages more attractive.</li><br>

                <li>Hence, if you want to know about the history of CSS from its origin to now. Then read this essential
                    article
                    because it has several things that will help you understand CSS. You will also understand how CSS
                    won
                    over
                    other styling languages of that time.</li>
